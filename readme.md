## ⚙️ How It Works (Workflow)

1.  **Authentication:** Users log in securely. The server issues an HTTP-Only cookie containing the JWT.
2.  **Role Verification:** Every API request passes through a `protectRoute` middleware that verifies the token and checks the user's role permissions.
3.  **Data Retrieval (Optimized):**
    - **Step A:** The server checks **Redis Cache**. If data exists, it's returned immediately (Speed: ~10ms).
    - **Step B:** If not in cache, the server queries **MongoDB**, sends the response, and stores it in Redis for future requests (TTL: 1 hour).
4.  **Frontend Rendering:** The React frontend receives the data and uses **Zustand** to update the UI instantly without page reloads.
